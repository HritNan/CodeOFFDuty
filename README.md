Many people dont know how to calculate BMI or either find it too boring to calculate their BMI and thus dont know whether they themselves are healthy or not. Many health problems arise if a person is obese so if a person can estimate their BMI by just uploading their photo, they will be able to know about their health conditions and focus on improving their health . In Medial Field also many illnesses can be predicted beforehand and can be alerted to the concerned person about thehealth issues they might have to face due to their excess weight . Obesity is a major issue in the society these days and if people get to know beforehand that they are obese , this might ALARM them and they might focus on their health  and thus reducing their risk towards health illnesses.
