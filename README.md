# Aim
Here we use the image of user's face and try to predict the BMI(Body Mass Index),Age and Gender of the person
# The problem it solves
Many people dont know how to calculate BMI or either find it too boring to calculate their BMI and thus don't know whether they themselves are healthy or not. Many health problems arise if a person is obese so if a person can estimate their BMI by just uploading their photo, they will be able to know about their health conditions and focus on improving their health . In Medial Field also many illnesses can be predicted beforehand and can be alerted to the concerned person about thehealth issues they might have to face due to their excess weight . Obesity is a major issue in the society these days and if people get to know beforehand that they are obese , this might ALARM them and they might focus on their health  and thus reducing their risk towards health illnesses.

# USE As Marketing Strategy
Gyms,Fitness Trainers and Fitness Apps can use this as their marketing strategy. On Social Media Platforms, they can prompt the potential customers to check their BMI by just uploading their image and if the BMI is not in the healthy range, they can alert the customer about the problems they might have to face due to excess weight and tell them to join their Gym or take their app subscription so that they can live a healthy lifestyle!
